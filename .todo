COMPLETED:
✓ Added vote sites feature to maintainer console
✓ Fixed maintainer page crash (aggregate result guard)
✓ Fixed PresenceUpdate log spam (silent return for missing docs)
✓ Refactored all SiteSettings controllers to prevent accidental blank document creation:
  - GET requests (READ) never create/save documents - use configJS defaults if not found
  - POST requests (WRITE) create documents only when needed, save only with actual data
