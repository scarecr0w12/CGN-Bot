## 📝 Form Builder - Professional Applications Made Simple

Say goodbye to clunky Google Forms and complicated bots. Our **Form Builder** puts a powerful, native Discord form system right at your fingertips.

### What Makes It Special

**Visual Designer**
- Drag-and-drop field ordering
- Multiple field types (text, dropdown, multiple choice)
- Real-time preview as you build

**Automated Workflows**
- Submissions appear in designated channels
- One-click approve/reject buttons
- Automatic role assignment on approval
- Webhook integration for external tools

**Complete Response Management**
- View all submissions in one dashboard
- Filter by status (pending/approved/rejected)
- Add review notes for your team
- Track who reviewed what and when

### Common Use Cases

**Staff Applications**
Perfect for recruiting moderators, admins, or support staff. Create professional application forms with experience questions, availability checks, and scenario responses.

**Event Registration**
Collect sign-ups for tournaments, game nights, or community events. Automatically assign participant roles and send confirmation messages.

**Member Screening**
Implement verification processes for new members. Ask how they found your server, ensure they've read the rules, and gather initial information.

**Feedback Collection**
Gather structured feedback from your community about events, changes, or new features. Organize responses for easy analysis.

### Key Features

## 🎯 Why These Features Matter

### Compete with Top Bots

We analyzed the most popular Discord bots and identified critical gaps in our feature set. Social Media Alerts and Form Builder bring us on par with industry leaders like:

- **MEE6** - Social alerts and custom forms
- **Dyno** - Twitch/YouTube notifications  
- **ProBot** - Application system

Now you get these features **without adding multiple bots** to your server.

### Built for Growth

Both features are designed to help your community grow:

**Social Alerts** drive engagement by keeping members informed about content they care about. When a popular streamer in your community goes live, your members know immediately.

**Form Builder** professionalizes your operations. Whether you're recruiting staff or running events, structured applications make you look legitimate and organized.

### Seamless Integration

These aren't bolt-on features - they're deeply integrated into the SkynetBot ecosystem:

- Managed through our beautiful dashboard
- Respects server tier limits
- Works alongside existing features
- Native Discord UI (no external links)
