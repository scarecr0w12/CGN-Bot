## 💻 DEVELOPER TOOLS (TIER 2 - PREMIUM)

*Secure code execution via containerized Agent architecture. **Tier-gated:** Requires Tier 2 (Premium).*

### Security Architecture: Agent Containers (gVisor)

**Why gVisor?** User code executes in isolated containers with a user-space kernel that intercepts syscalls - attackers cannot reach the host kernel even if they escape the container.

```

**Implementation:**

- Runtime: Docker with `runsc` (gVisor) runtime
- Communication: HTTP API with signed payloads
- Container image: `skynet-sandbox` with Node.js, Python
- Lifecycle: Ephemeral (created per execution, auto-removed)
