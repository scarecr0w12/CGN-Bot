## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

Core Business Logic Architecture

1. Activity & Server Management (85/100)

- Custom server activity scoring using weighted member/message metrics
- Cross-server analytics for active status determination
- Server categorization and filtering for public listings
- Complex permission hierarchy with role-based controls

2. Extension Platform (85/100)
Path: Web/controllers/extensions.js

- Extension validation and versioning system
- State management through gallery/queue/published workflows
- Security sandboxing with permission controls
- Integrated version control for extensions

3. Administrative Controls (80/100)

- Moderation action tracking and enforcement systems
- Hierarchical admin permission management
- Server-specific automation rules
- Severity-based activity logging

4. Command Framework (70/100)

- Rate limiting with cooldown implementation
- Channel-specific permission controls
- Custom prefix handling per server
- Usage statistics and tracking

5. Wiki System (65/100)

- Version control with diff tracking
- Reaction and voting capabilities
- Contributor permission management
- Change history with user attribution

Core Integration Points:

- Extension system interfaces with command management
- Activity scoring feeds into server categorization
- Permission system spans across all components
- Moderation actions integrate with logging system

The system architecture prioritizes:

- Server management automation
- Extensible command framework
- Multi-tiered permissions
- Activity-based server organization
