# moderation-system-model

The moderation system implements a progressive strike and infraction tracking model with automated escalation rules.

Core Components:

1. Strike System (Modules/ModLog.js)
- Progressive strike accumulation with configurable thresholds
- Automated escalation based on strike count:
  - 3 strikes: 24 hour mute
  - 5 strikes: 7 day ban
  - 7 strikes: permanent ban
- Strike decay rules with 30-day expiration
- Strike categories with weighted severity
Importance Score: 90

2. Infraction Tracking (Web/controllers/dashboard/administration.js)
- Detailed infraction records with:
  - Timestamp
  - Moderator ID
  - Action type
  - Duration
  - Reason
- Case ID system for cross-referencing
- Appeal tracking and resolution workflow
Importance Score: 85

3. Automated Actions (Commands/Public/strike.js)
- Threshold-based automated punishments
- Configurable warning messages
- Notification system for affected users
- Integration with Discord audit log
Importance Score: 80

4. Administrative Hierarchy
- Multi-level moderation permissions (0-3)
- Role-based access control for mod actions
- Override capabilities for higher-level mods
- Audit logging of permission usage
Importance Score: 75

Key Data Models:
```
Infraction {
  caseId: String
