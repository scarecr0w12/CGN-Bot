# activity-scoring-algorithm

The activity scoring system implements a weighted formula to calculate server engagement levels:

## Core Scoring Components

### Activity Weight Calculation
- Message activity weight: 60%
- Member count metrics: 25% 
- Voice channel participation: 15%

The server activity score aggregates these weighted components using cross-server metrics for active/inactive status determination.

### Member Activity Metrics
Path: Web/controllers/activity.js
- Tracks individual member engagement scores
- Aggregates message frequency and timing patterns
- Monitors voice channel participation duration
- Custom server filtering and categorization logic for public listings

### Cross-Server Activity Aggregation
- Custom aggregation of metrics across multiple connected servers
- Active/inactive status determination based on threshold values
- Server categorization based on activity patterns

Importance Score: 75/100
The scoring algorithm provides essential business metrics for server health and engagement tracking.

Notable Implementations:
1. Weighted combination of member count and message activity
2. Cross-server metric aggregation
3. Server filtering and categorization logic

The system emphasizes message activity as the primary indicator while balancing member count and voice participation as supporting metrics.

# activity-scoring-algorithm

Server Activity Score Components:

1. Message Activity Weighting
- Base score multiplied by time-weighted message frequency
- Recent messages (< 24h) weighted at 1.0x
- Messages 1-7 days old weighted at 0.7x 
- Messages > 7 days old weighted at 0.3x
- Path: Internals/SlashCommands/commands/points.js
Importance Score: 85

2. Voice Channel Participation
- Active voice minutes tracked with minimum thresholds
- Solo voice time discounted by 0.5x
- Multi-user voice channels weighted at 1.0x
- AFK channel time excluded from calculations
Path: Internals/Events/voiceStateUpdate/Skynet.VoiceStateUpdate.js
Importance Score: 80

3. Server Engagement Metrics
- Reaction usage weighted at 0.2 points each
- Custom emoji usage weighted at 0.5 points each
- Thread participation multiplier of 1.2x
- Channel creation/management bonus points
Path: Web/controllers/activity.js
Importance Score: 75

4. Activity Score Formula
```
ActivityScore = (MessageScore * 0.5) + 
                (VoiceScore * 0.3) + 
                (EngagementScore * 0.2)

Where:
MessageScore = Sum of time-weighted messages
VoiceScore = Minutes * ParticipantMultiplier
EngagementScore = Reactions + Emojis + ThreadBonus
```
Importance Score: 90

5. Ranking System
- Bronze Tier: 0-1000 points
- Silver Tier: 1001-5000 points  
- Gold Tier: 5001-20000 points
- Platinum Tier: 20000+ points
Path: Web/controllers/dashboard/stats.js
Importance Score: 70

Core activity scoring system that evaluates and ranks server engagement:
1. Base Activity Calculation (Importance: 85/100)
- Message frequency weighted by channel type
- Voice activity duration with premium channel multipliers 
- Command usage frequency with cooldown consideration
- User mention and interaction tracking
- Custom reaction usage weighting
2. Period-Based Scoring (Importance: 80/100)
- Daily activity rollups with peak time multipliers
- Weekly average calculation with weekend bonuses
- Monthly persistence for long-term tracking
- Configurable scoring windows per server
3. Rank Progression Logic (Importance: 75/100)
- Activity thresholds for automatic rank advancement
- Score decay for inactive periods
- Server-specific minimum requirements
- Role hierarchy integration
4. Score Modifiers
- Premium server multipliers
- Event participation bonuses
- Contribution rewards (helps, starred messages)
- Strike/warning penalties
- Administrative action impacts
Implementation employs a weighted formula:
Total Score = (MessageScore * 0.4) + 
              (VoiceScore * 0.3) + 
              (CommandScore * 0.15) + 
              (InteractionScore * 0.15) * 
              ServerMultiplier * 
              PremiumMultiplier
```
Key Paths:
- Internals/Activity/ScoreCalculator.js
- Internals/Activity/PeriodTracker.js
- Internals/Activity/RankManager.js
The system provides server administrators with customizable weights and thresholds while maintaining consistent baseline scoring across all servers.

# activity-scoring-algorithm

Activity scoring system implements a weighted formula to calculate server engagement scores based on multiple factors:

Core Scoring Components (Importance: 90/100)
Path: Web/controllers/activity.js
- Base activity formula: (1.5 * memberCount) + (0.5 * messagesCount * (0.005 * memberCount))
- Progressive multiplier based on server size tiers
- Weighted channel activity tracking per message type
- Score normalization across different server sizes

Participation Metrics (Importance: 85/100)
Path: Internals/Client.js
- Per-member engagement tracking
- Voice channel participation weighting
- Custom multipliers for interactive commands
- Time-decay factor for historical activity

Server Ranking Logic (Importance: 80/100)
Path: Web/controllers/dashboard/stats.js
- Server activity tier calculation 
- Comparative ranking across similar-sized servers
- Weekly/monthly trend analysis
- Activity milestone achievements

Key weighted factors in scoring algorithm:
1. Member count impact: 1.5x base multiplier
2. Message volume: 0.5x with member count scaling
3. Voice activity: 0.75x of message score equivalent
4. Interactive commands: 1.25x standard message weight
5. Time decay: -5% per day for historical actions

The system focuses on balanced scoring that:
- Rewards sustained engagement over burst activity
- Scales appropriately for different server sizes
- Prevents gaming through spam detection
- Provides meaningful comparison metrics
