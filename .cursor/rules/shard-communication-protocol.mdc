# shard-communication-protocol

From the available specification, very limited information exists about the actual shard communication protocol. The core components identified are:

Importance Score: 80/100

## Core Protocol Components

1. Inter-Process Communication
- Custom implementation of shard coordination logic
- Guild data synchronization mechanisms between shards
- Centralized command routing system across shards

2. State Management 
- Bot state synchronization across distributed instances
- Server-specific configuration sharing between shards
- Member activity data propagation

## Key Communication Patterns

1. Guild Data Distribution
- Sharded guild information sharing
- Server configuration synchronization
- Member permission coordination

2. Command Routing
- Cross-shard command execution
- Distributed response handling
- Shard-aware message routing

The protocol appears to be built specifically for Discord bot shard management with domain-specific features for guild data synchronization and distributed command handling.

# shard-communication-protocol

The shard communication protocol implements specialized inter-process messaging for distributed Discord bot operations:

## Message Types

1. Guild State Synchronization
- Specialized message format for cross-shard guild data updates
- Maintains consistent guild settings across distributed shards
- Handles guild migration events between shards
Importance Score: 85

2. Moderation Actions
- Cross-shard moderation command synchronization
- Member status updates (mutes, bans, warns) propagation
- Distributed strike system coordination
Importance Score: 80

3. Activity Updates 
- Bot presence synchronization across shards
- Cross-shard statistics aggregation
- Global command usage tracking
Importance Score: 75

4. Extension State Management
- Extension lifecycle event broadcasting
- Shared extension configuration updates
- Cross-shard extension reload coordination
Importance Score: 85

## Protocol Components

1. Master Process Management
Path: master.js
- Centralized shard orchestration
- IPC message routing and delivery guarantees
- Shard health monitoring and recovery
Importance Score: 90

2. Cross-Shard Queries
- Distributed data request handling
- Response aggregation from multiple shards
- Query timeout and retry logic
Importance Score: 80

The protocol focuses on maintaining consistent state across distributed bot instances while handling Discord-specific requirements for guild management and moderation.
