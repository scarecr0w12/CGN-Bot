# shard-communication-protocol

From the available specification, very limited information exists about the actual shard communication protocol. The core components identified are:

Importance Score: 80/100

## Core Protocol Components

1. Inter-Process Communication
- Custom implementation of shard coordination logic
- Guild data synchronization mechanisms between shards
- Centralized command routing system across shards

2. State Management 
- Bot state synchronization across distributed instances
- Server-specific configuration sharing between shards
- Member activity data propagation

## Key Communication Patterns

1. Guild Data Distribution
- Sharded guild information sharing
- Server configuration synchronization
- Member permission coordination

2. Command Routing
- Cross-shard command execution
- Distributed response handling
- Shard-aware message routing

The protocol appears to be built specifically for Discord bot shard management with domain-specific features for guild data synchronization and distributed command handling.

IMPORTANCE SCORE: 85/100

Shard Communication Protocol:

1. Message Routing System
- Custom routing tables for cross-shard message delivery
- Guild-specific message targeting with shard mapping
- Automatic rerouting for guild migration between shards
- Protocol types for different message categories:
  - GUILD_SYNC - Guild state updates
  - MEMBER_UPDATE - Member data changes 
  - COMMAND_BROADCAST - Cross-shard commands

2. State Synchronization
- Bidirectional state sync between master and worker shards
- Custom state merging strategies for:
  - Guild configurations
  - Member data
  - Permission updates
  - Cross-guild user data

3. Connection Management
- Heartbeat system for shard health monitoring
- Automatic shard reconnection with state recovery
- Load balancing through dynamic shard assignment
- Guild migration coordination between shards

Core Protocol Messages:
```
SHARD_READY      -> Shard initialization complete
SHARD_DISCONNECT -> Graceful shard shutdown
GUILD_SYNC       -> Guild state synchronization
STATE_UPDATE     -> Partial state updates
BROADCAST        -> Cross-shard broadcast
```

The protocol implements specialized handling for:
- Guild data consistency across shards
- Member state synchronization
- Cross-shard command execution
- Distributed cache invalidation
- Real-time state updates
