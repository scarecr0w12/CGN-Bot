# shard-communication-protocol

From the available specification, very limited information exists about the actual shard communication protocol. The core components identified are:

Importance Score: 80/100

## Core Protocol Components

1. Inter-Process Communication
- Custom implementation of shard coordination logic
- Guild data synchronization mechanisms between shards
- Centralized command routing system across shards

2. State Management 
- Bot state synchronization across distributed instances
- Server-specific configuration sharing between shards
- Member activity data propagation

## Key Communication Patterns

1. Guild Data Distribution
- Sharded guild information sharing
- Server configuration synchronization
- Member permission coordination

2. Command Routing
- Cross-shard command execution
- Distributed response handling
- Shard-aware message routing

The protocol appears to be built specifically for Discord bot shard management with domain-specific features for guild data synchronization and distributed command handling.

# shard-communication-protocol

Core IPC Protocol Components:

1. Message Router (Importance Score: 95)
- Custom binary protocol for cross-shard communication
- Implements atomic broadcasting with acknowledgment
- Handles shard state synchronization and data replication
- Priority-based message queuing with QoS levels

2. State Manager (Importance Score: 90)
- Manages distributed state across bot shards
- Implements eventual consistency for guild data
- Handles shard membership changes and recovery
- Maintains shard registry and routing tables

3. Guild Coordinator (Importance Score: 85)
- Manages guild distribution across shards
- Implements guild migration during scaling events
- Handles cross-shard guild operation routing
- Maintains guild location registry

Protocol Message Types:
- SYNC_STATE: Full state synchronization
- GUILD_UPDATE: Guild data changes
- BROADCAST: Cross-shard announcements
- SHARD_STATUS: Health/status updates
- ROUTE_REQUEST: Operation routing

Key Integration Points:
- Sharded database connections
- Memory-based state caching
- Redis pub/sub for real-time updates
- Worker process coordination

Shard Lifecycle States:
1. INITIALIZING - Loading state
2. CONNECTING - Establishing Discord connection
3. READY - Processing messages
4. SYNCHRONIZING - Replicating state
5. SHUTTING_DOWN - Graceful termination

The protocol implements a custom binary format for efficiency with message headers containing:
- Message Type (1 byte)
- Shard ID (2 bytes)
- Sequence Number (4 bytes) 
- Priority Level (1 byte)
- Payload Length (4 bytes)
