## Core Extension Management Components
Importance Score: 85/100

### Validation & Security System
- Custom extension validation workflow with security scanning
- Sandboxed execution environment for extension code 
- Extension state management (gallery, queue, published)
- Version control system with acceptance workflows
- Security scoping and permission controls

### Extension Lifecycle Management 
Path: Web/controllers/extensions.js
- Version tracking and deployment pipeline
- Code verification with MD5 hash validation
- Extension type categorization (commands, keywords, timers, events)
- Integrated extension builder interface
- State transitions between draft, review, and published

### Permission Controls
- Scoped permission system for extension execution
- Hierarchical admin levels for extension approval
- Role-based access control for extension management
- Extension-specific filter and automation rules
- Activity logging with categorized severity levels

### Version Management
- Custom versioning system with diff tracking
- Version control integration for extensions
- Change history with user attribution
- Automated version numbering
- Rollback capabilities for problematic versions

The extension system implements a comprehensive marketplace workflow focusing on:
1. Security-first validation approach
2. Granular permission management
3. Version control and deployment
4. Extension lifecycle states

## Extension Validation System (Importance: 85)
- Multi-stage validation pipeline for submitted extensions
- Custom security scanning for malicious code patterns 
- Version compatibility checks against bot core
- Automated test suite execution for new submissions
- File path: Web/controllers/dashboard/extension-validation.js

## Extension Versioning Logic (Importance: 80)
- Semantic versioning enforcement for extensions
- Breaking change detection between versions
- Automated compatibility matrix generation
- Version-specific feature flagging system
- File path: Web/controllers/dashboard/extension-versioning.js

## Permission Management (Importance: 90)
- Multi-tier permission system for extension management:
  - Extension Owners: Full control over own extensions
  - Maintainers: Review and approve submissions
  - Administrators: Global marketplace management
- Cross-server extension authorization
- Role-based access control for extension features
- File path: Web/middleware/extension-permissions.js

## Marketplace Workflow (Importance: 85)
- Extension submission pipeline:
  1. Initial submission with metadata
  2. Automated validation checks
  3. Manual review queue
  4. Approval/rejection with feedback
  5. Publication to marketplace
- Point-based monetization system
- Extension rating and review system
- File path: Web/controllers/dashboard/marketplace.js

## Extension Installation Flow (Importance: 75) 
- Server-specific extension configuration
- Dependency resolution and conflict checking
- Automated rollback on failed installations
- Extension state persistence
- File path: Web/controllers/dashboard/extension-install.js
