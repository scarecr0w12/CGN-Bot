## Core Extension Management Components
Importance Score: 85/100

### Validation & Security System
- Custom extension validation workflow with security scanning
- Sandboxed execution environment for extension code 
- Extension state management (gallery, queue, published)
- Version control system with acceptance workflows
- Security scoping and permission controls

### Extension Lifecycle Management 
Path: Web/controllers/extensions.js
- Version tracking and deployment pipeline
- Code verification with MD5 hash validation
- Extension type categorization (commands, keywords, timers, events)
- Integrated extension builder interface
- State transitions between draft, review, and published

### Permission Controls
- Scoped permission system for extension execution
- Hierarchical admin levels for extension approval
- Role-based access control for extension management
- Extension-specific filter and automation rules
- Activity logging with categorized severity levels

### Version Management
- Custom versioning system with diff tracking
- Version control integration for extensions
- Change history with user attribution
- Automated version numbering
- Rollback capabilities for problematic versions

The extension system implements a comprehensive marketplace workflow focusing on:
1. Security-first validation approach
2. Granular permission management
3. Version control and deployment
4. Extension lifecycle states

- File path: Internals/Extensions/ExtensionManager.js

4. Permission Management
- Granular capability control system
- Server-specific extension permissions
- Author verification and trust levels
- Resource access scoping
- File path: Internals/Extensions/permissions.js

5. Extension Marketplace
- Rating and review system
