## Core Extension Management Components
Importance Score: 85/100

### Validation & Security System
- Custom extension validation workflow with security scanning
- Sandboxed execution environment for extension code 
- Extension state management (gallery, queue, published)
- Version control system with acceptance workflows
- Security scoping and permission controls

### Extension Lifecycle Management 
Path: Web/controllers/extensions.js
- Version tracking and deployment pipeline
- Code verification with MD5 hash validation
- Extension type categorization (commands, keywords, timers, events)
- Integrated extension builder interface
- State transitions between draft, review, and published

### Permission Controls
- Scoped permission system for extension execution
- Hierarchical admin levels for extension approval
- Role-based access control for extension management
- Extension-specific filter and automation rules
- Activity logging with categorized severity levels

### Version Management
- Custom versioning system with diff tracking
- Version control integration for extensions
- Change history with user attribution
- Automated version numbering
- Rollback capabilities for problematic versions

The extension system implements a comprehensive marketplace workflow focusing on:
1. Security-first validation approach
2. Granular permission management
3. Version control and deployment
4. Extension lifecycle states

Core Extension Management Components:

1. Extension Marketplace System
Path: Web/controllers/extensions.js
- Multi-tier marketplace with free and premium extensions
- Version control system with semantic versioning enforcement
- Extension package validation and security scanning
- Author verification and reputation tracking
Importance Score: 85

2. Extension Sandbox Environment 
Path: Internals/Extensions/API/IsolatedSandbox.js
- Secure extension execution with isolated-vm
- Memory and CPU usage limits per extension
- Custom module resolution with allowlist
- Granular permission system for extension capabilities
Importance Score: 90

3. Extension Deployment Pipeline
Path: Internals/Extensions/ExtensionManager.js
- Automated validation of extension dependencies
- Cross-instance compatibility verification
- Extension state management and lifecycle hooks
- Hot-reload capability with rollback support 
Importance Score: 80

Key Extension Workflows:

1. Publication Flow:
- Package validation
- Security scan
- Version verification
- Author authentication
- Distribution preparation

2. Installation Flow:
- Compatibility check
- Permission validation
- Resource allocation
- Sandbox preparation
- State initialization

3. Management Flow:
- Update detection
- Version migration
- Configuration sync
- Usage monitoring
- Resource cleanup

The system implements strict security measures through sandboxing while providing flexible extension capabilities. Extension lifecycles are fully managed from publication through deployment and maintenance.
