## Core Extension Management Components
Importance Score: 85/100

### Validation & Security System
- Custom extension validation workflow with security scanning
- Sandboxed execution environment for extension code 
- Extension state management (gallery, queue, published)
- Version control system with acceptance workflows
- Security scoping and permission controls

### Extension Lifecycle Management 
Path: Web/controllers/extensions.js
- Version tracking and deployment pipeline
- Code verification with MD5 hash validation
- Extension type categorization (commands, keywords, timers, events)
- Integrated extension builder interface
- State transitions between draft, review, and published

### Permission Controls
- Scoped permission system for extension execution
- Hierarchical admin levels for extension approval
- Role-based access control for extension management
- Extension-specific filter and automation rules
- Activity logging with categorized severity levels

### Version Management
- Custom versioning system with diff tracking
- Version control integration for extensions
- Change history with user attribution
- Automated version numbering
- Rollback capabilities for problematic versions

The extension system implements a comprehensive marketplace workflow focusing on:
1. Security-first validation approach
2. Granular permission management
3. Version control and deployment
4. Extension lifecycle states

Importance Score: 85/100

Extension Lifecycle Management:

1. Extension States
- Three primary states: gallery, queue, third-party
- State transitions controlled by validation pipeline
- Custom versioning system with semantic version enforcement
- Installation validation with configuration requirements

2. Permission Management
- Multi-tier access control system for extension management
- Role-based permissions for publishing and installation
- Custom validation rules for extension capabilities
- Maintainer privilege hierarchy with sudo mode

3. Extension Validation Pipeline
- Custom validation workflow for new extensions
- Version compatibility checking
- Dependency resolution and conflict detection
- Configuration schema validation
- Security scanning for malicious code patterns

4. Extension Marketplace Integration
- Gallery state management for public extensions
- Queue system for pending approvals
- Third-party extension tracking
- Custom deployment pipeline for approved extensions

File Paths:
/Web/controllers/extensions.js
/Web/middleware/auth.js

The extension management system implements a sophisticated workflow for handling extension lifecycles, with strong emphasis on security and validation. The permission system integrates with the broader platform authentication while providing extension-specific access controls.
